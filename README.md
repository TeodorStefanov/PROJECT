Views is built using Next.js, the latest version of the React-based JavaScript web framework, and is written in TypeScript. It is a social network that is similar to Facebook and Instagram, allowing users to create profiles, post content, comment on posts, and interact with one another. The website has an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily access their profile, create posts, view other posts, and interact with other users. Additionally, users can set their privacy settings to control who can view their posts and who can comment on them.
